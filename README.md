# CODING AND MAKING SOME WEB APPS
So firstly what you need to get is:                                           
     • Your Program (PyCharm or VSCode)                                                                         
     • Create a project there and your structure should be like this:

`├── Your project folder                                                                                                    
   ├── file.py                                                                                                               
   └── subfolder(name it "templates")                                                                                           
      └── yourfile.hmtl                              `
So once you have all positioned correctly we can test our program!
Go to 'FlaskFile.py' and put the script in your file.py                            
Then go to index.hmtl and put the script in your .hmtl file                           
# Now let's see the code!
Firstly we go with hmtl script:

So now we will run it and check it:

And when we enter we should see a :) in the final of the text:

# SO TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF AND ENJOY MAKING WEB APPS!
